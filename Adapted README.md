This version of yolo v3 runs using Tensorflow

I got all the code from https://github.com/aloyschen/tensorflow-yolo3 and made some changes in the file config and detect

Along with the scripts you will need to download the following weights file 'YOLOv3-416' from this website https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ 
and store it inside the model_data folder

Make sure you have downloaded tensorflow packages (pip install tensorflow) and anything else you might need to run the program

TO DO:
1) Output detects way to few objects, figure out why
2) Encorporate multithreating
3) Download packages that allow for the use of GPU
